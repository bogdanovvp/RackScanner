Windows:
- install miniconda from Continuum Analytics (32 bit in case you want to use the AVA6 TWAIN driver)
- in the Anaconda prompt:
- clone https://github.com/michalkahle/RackScanner.git
- cd to install directory, then run: 
	conda env create -f conda_env.yaml
	(or if it fails: conda create --name RackScanner --file conda_env_win32.txt)
- run command: activate RackScanner
- install binary packages by pip:
	pip install pydmtx-0.7.4b1-cp27-none-win32.whl
	pip install twain-1.0.4-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl
- run vcredist_x86.exe
- cd ..
- python http_server.py
- create settings.py by copying settings_template.py
- in settings.py change the mode of operation to one of 'scanner' or 'read_last'

instalation of AVA6 driver in Windows 8.1:
- restart the system with driver signature enforcement turned off!
- run the original installer from the CD and install TWAIN and W?? driver (might not be necessary)
- from Device Manager start the driver update process
- select driver manually -> have a disk
- select the installer directory Avision Scanner\Driver\TWAIN
- you should get warning about insalling unsigned drivers. Proceed.
- unplug, plug the USB cable. The scanner should work now.
- only 32 bit TWAIN is supported!
